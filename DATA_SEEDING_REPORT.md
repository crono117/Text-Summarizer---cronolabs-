## 6. Known Issues / Notes

2. **Warning**: Docker Compose version attribute obsolete - Can be safely removed from docker-compose.lite.yml

### Recommendations:
1. Consider updating ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py for production deployment
2. Set ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION to 'mandatory' for production
3. Configure proper email backend for production (currently using console backend)
